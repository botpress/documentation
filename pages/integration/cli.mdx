# Introduction
The Botpress Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for developers to manage their Botpress projects efficiently. From your command line, you can handle various tasks such as bot creation, integration management, project initialization, and deployment to the Botpress Cloud.

The CLI is distributed as an npm package, meaning it can easily be integrated into your Node.js environment, with support for yarn and pnpm package managers.

This guide will help you install and utilize the Botpress CLI, demonstrating its extensive range of commands and how it can simplify your bot development process.

# Installation

The CLI is available as an npm package. It can be installed globally or locally.

```bash
npm install -g @botpress/cli # for npm
yarn global add @botpress/cli # for yarn
pnpm install -g @botpress/cli # for pnpm
```

# Usage

Here's the result of running `bp --help`:

```bash
bp <command>

  bp login                 Login to Botpress Cloud
  bp logout                Logout of Botpress Cloud
