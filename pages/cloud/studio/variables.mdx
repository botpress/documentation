# Variables

Botpress uses variables to store information from one place and use it in other parts of a flow. Variables help make conversations more personalized, and help track information about users. They can also help connect with third-party APIs and data sources.

## Data Types for Variables

Botpress variables are typed, meaning they are limited in what data they can hold. Not only are these data types important to ensure the code behind Botpress runs smoothly, but these types also help AI tasks generate better results. Here are the different data types available for Botpress variables:

| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| String  | Values that are treated as text. Strings can contain any amount of letters, numbers, or special characters. <br/> <br/> Example uses: Storing a user's name, store an AI task's generated message.                                                                              |
| Boolean | Variables can either be true or false, with a lowercase 't' or 'f'. <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing if a user is a returning customer, storing whether the bot has greeted the user or not                                                                                     |
| Number  | Variables that are numeric, either with or without decimal places. <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing a user's phone number, storing an address's area code                                                                                                                       |
| Date    | Variables that are a single date or date and time. Botpress uses ISO 8601 date/time format, such as `20220921T10:34:14` for `21 September 2023 at 10:34 AM` (with 14 seconds). <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing when the user started a chat, storing a user's appointment date |
| Object  | Variable that is a collection of key-value pairs. Useful when dealing with code and written like `{key: value}`. <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing a user's profile, storing the results of an API call                                                                          |
| Array   | Variable that is a collection of other, similar variables. Arrays can contain strings, like `[“a”, “b”, “c”]`, or Objects like `[{key:value},{key:value}]`. <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing a user's past messages, storing options for the user to choose from                |
| Enum    | Variable that can be one of a set number of choices. <br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing days of the week, storing items available from a food menu                                                                                                                                |
| Pattern | Variable that uses Regular Expressions/Regex to store a special pattern. This pattern can match with certain words or numbers.<br/> <br/>Example uses: Storing account numbers, storing flight numbers                                                                          |

## Variable Scopes

Botpress also includes different types of variables. These variable types differ in their scope, or where they can be accessed in your bot's flows. Let's start with the most limited scoped variables and then end with the broadest scoped.

## Workflow Variables

Workflow Variables are created and used only within a single workflow. These variables are great for single-use or in standalone flows, such as:

1. Storing an AI Task's output
2. Saving the user's answer to a question
3. Organizing data returned from an API call
4. Saving flags or tags that track the conversation

<Callout type="info">
  **Workflow Variables**
  <br />
  Workflow variables are not accessible in any workflow other than the one they were created in. For example, a workflow
  variable created in a separate workflow will not be accessible in **Main**.
</Callout>

### How to make workflow variables

To create a Variable in your bot's workflow, you can follow these steps:

1. Select the appropriate workflow from the Explorer menu.
2. Double-click on the empty space in the workflow editor to open the Inspector panel.
3. In the Inspector panel, navigate to the flow properties section.
4. Give your variable a name, pick a type and click "Add" to create the variable.
5. You can also add default(initial) value for a variable from the Additional Settings.
6. Once the variable is created, you can use `{{workflow.variablename}}` or `@variablename` to display it in a send message card.

### Input and Output Workflow Variables

Workflows can have inputs and outputs to help pass information throughout the bot. This can be useful if your workflow returns information like a verified phone number, or requires information like a user id.

#### To mark an input variable

1. Go into your workflow and create the variable
2. Click on the **Entry** node
3. In the inspector panel, click on the variable you want to make an input. It should get a blue border and appear in the **Entry** node.
4. When you call this workflow from another flow, there should be an input box for that variable in the workflow's card. This will let you pass information or another variable into that workflow.

#### To mark an output variable

1. Go into your workflow and create the variable
2. Click on the **Exit** node
3. In the inspector panel, click on the variable you want to make an output. It should get a blue border and appear in the **Exit** node.
4. When you call this workflow from another flow, the output variable will be accessible by typing `{{workflow.<workflowname>.<variablename>}}`, replacing `<workflowname>` and `<variablename>` with the name of your workflow and variable respectively.

## Session Variables

Session variables are available in all flows, but only for one conversation. These variables are great for data used throughout a conversation, such as:

1. Collecting items in a virtual shopping cart for the user to order
2. Saving raw data from an API call for further processing
3. Storing chat history for that conversation
4. Saving an order number or policy number

### How to make session variables

Session variables can only be created inside of an **Execute Code** card.

To create one, simply write: `event.state.session.variablename = "Hello World"` or for short `session.variablename = "Hello World"`

To use a session variable in a text or other card, enclose it in double curly brackets like `{{event.state.session.variablename}}` or for short `{{session.variablename}}`

## User Variables

User Variables are variables that follow a user between conversations. For example, if a user speaks with your bot on Monday and Wednesday, any user variables set on Monday will still be accessible on Wednesday. User variables are great for storing data that doesn't change very often, such as:
Storing users' personal details or id numbers

1. Collecting tags or notes from past conversations
2. Storing extra flags like **VIP customer**
3. Saving language preferences

### How to make user variables

To create a user variable:

1. Click the Botpress icon in the upper-left corner and select “Chatbot Settings\*\*
2. Click on the tab for **Variables**
3. Click on the button to add a user variable and fill in the variable's name and data type and click **Done**
4. You can use your variable in a text card with either `@user.variablename` or in double curly brackets like `{{user.variablename}}`.

## Bot Variables

Bot Variables can be accessed by all users of the chatbot across all conversations. They are typically used for configuration and developer information, such as:

1. Storing the endpoint for the bot's API calls
2. Saving bot's version number
3. Storing the bot's name

Bot variables are not encrypted or stored securely. Do not save secrets like API keys or passwords in bot variables- use configuration variables instead!

### How to make bot variables

To create a bot variable:

1. Click the Botpress icon in the upper-left corner and select **Chatbot Settings**
2. Click on the tab for **Variables**
3. Click on the button to add a bot variable and fill in the variable's name and data type and select **Done**

Bot variables can be used in text and other cards just like user variables- with either `@bot.variablename` or `{{bot.variablename}}`.

## Configuration Variables

Configuration variables are a special kind of secure bot variable. They can also be managed from the Cloud Dashboard without opening the bot. Configuration variables can store secrets like:

- API Tokens
- Private IP Addresses
- Database usernames and passwords

### How to make configuration variables

To create a configuration variable:

1. Click the Botpress icon in the upper-left corner and select **Chatbot Settings**
2. Click on the tab for **Variables**
3. Scroll down and click on the button to add a configuration variable. Fill in the variable's name and value and Select **Done**

You can use env.key in your code to get the value of the Configuration Variable.To use it in an Execute Code Card, you can write env.key to access its value.
Once a configuration variable is created, you can access and manage it from the cloud admin dashboard. Just select your bot and then click on the tab for **Configuration Variables.**

## Using Variables in code

You can use variables in code without any double curly brackets or `@` signs. Variables follow the pattern variabletype.variablename. For example:

- `workflow.phoneNumber`
- `session.userAcctId`
- `user.firstName`
- `bot.endpoint`
- `env.apiKey`

Variables can be assigned values or updated in code- just be aware of their types! Botpress will throw an error if you try to set a variable of one type equal to a different type.
Displaying Variables

You can either use `{{workflow.variablename}}` or `@variablename` in a text field to display a variable.

## Passing Variables between Flows

1. In your target workflow, define an input variable from the workflow properties window.
2. Toggle it `ON` on the `Entry node` of the target workflow.
3. Now, on the `exit` node of the parent workflow, the one that brings the user to the target workflow, match the parent workflow variable with the target workflow input variable.
4. Now, when you call the target workflow from the parent workflow, you will see the input variable in the card. You can pass a value or a variable to it.
