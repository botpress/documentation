On the Left Panel in your Botpress Studio, Click the ⚙️ icon to open up Chatbot Settings.

## General Settings

### Chatbot Name

The **Chatbot Name** refers to the name of your chatbot that will be displayed as the identity or persona of the bot on various channels. It represents the character or entity that users interact with when communicating with the chatbot.

For example, if you have a chatbot designed to assist customers with travel bookings, you may choose an Avatar Name like **Travel Buddy**, **WanderlustBot**, or **TravelGuideX**. These names convey the bot's role and create an engaging and friendly persona for users to interact with.

On the other hand, if your chatbot is focused on providing technical support for software products, you might opt for a more professional-sounding Avatar Name like **TechAssist**, **SupportBot**, or **TechGenius**.

### Language

With Botpress, you can build chatbots that are able to converse with people in 50+ pre-loaded languages.

To customize your chatbot's language, follow these steps:

- Open the dropdown menu and select your preferred language.
- Ensure that the personality rewrite option is enabled to apply the changes.
- Once the changes are applied, your chatbot will use the selected language for its interactions.

### Personality Rewrite

![Styling Webchat](/docs/content/chatbot-personality.png)

When the feature of personality rewriting is enabled, it means that the messages sent by the bot will be modified or rewritten to match the specific personality of the bot. This can be done by programming the bot to use specific language patterns, tone, and expressions that reflect the personality traits of the bot.

For example, if the bot has been designed to have a friendly and casual personality, its messages may use more informal language and include emojis or other forms of digital communication commonly associated with a friendly tone. Alternatively, if the bot is designed to be more professional and formal, its messages may use more formal language and adopt a more serious tone.

The purpose of personality rewriting is to make the bot's communication more engaging and natural for users. By matching the bot's personality to the message being sent, it can create a more personalized and relatable experience for the user, increasing the likelihood that they will engage with the bot further.

## Variables

### User Variables

[User Variables](../../../cloud/studio/variables/#user-variables) are associated with individual users and are persistent. These variables can be set and accessed during the conversation with the chatbot. Examples of user variables may include user preferences or settings.

### Bot Variables

[Bot Variables](../../../cloud/studio/variables/#bot-variables), on the other hand, are the same for all users of the bot and can be used to store information that is relevant to the chatbot's functionality or behavior.

### Configuration Variables

[Configuration Variables](../../../cloud/studio/variables/#configuration-variables) are containers that store essential information such as API keys and database credentials, and allow chatbot developers to easily access and modify them as needed.
