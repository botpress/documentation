You can create custom object schemas (variable types) to validate the data you are working with. This is useful when you want to ensure that the data you are working with is in the correct format.

1. Create a schema for a user object with the following properties:
```js
zui.object({
  name: zui.string(),
  age: zui.number(),
  email: zui.string().email(),
  address: zui.object({
    street: zui.string(),
    city: zui.string(),
    zip: zui.string().length(5)
  })
})
```
2. Create a Variable of the user schema type and name it `UserInformation`.
