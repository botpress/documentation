# Files API

The Files API allows you to upload, download, and manage files and searchable documents for your bots and integrations in Botpress Cloud.

Files can be in any text or binary format, and documents (such as PDF, Microsoft Office, HTML, CSV, etc.) can be indexed to be used for semantic search in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementations. Files are private by default but can be made publicly accessible through a permanent URL that's unique for each file.

## Getting Started

1. Get familiarized with the [API reference](/api-documentation/#files) and the different API endpoints available

2. Review the [instructions on how to authenticate](/api-documentation/#authentication) with the API.

## Examples

### Creating and uploading a file

#### In an Execute Card in your bot

The following code snippet can be put in an Execute Card in your bot to create and upload a file that can be accessed by anyone with the file URL and that will be indexed for semantic search:

> Note: Make sure you have enabled the "Use the Botpress Client" setting in your bot's settings in Botpress Studio in order to have access to the `client` global variable, otherwise it will not be accessible and you'll get an error.

```javascript
const file = await client.createAndUploadFile({
  name: 'test.txt',
  content: 'This is a test file',
  accessPolicies: ['public_content'], // Remove this line if you want the file to be private
  index: true, // Remove this line if you don't want the file to be indexed
  tags: {
    // Tags are optional but are useful for filtering files by a custom criteria you choose when using the "List Files" or "Search Files" API endpoints
    myTag1: 'value_1',
    myTag2: 'value_2',
  },
})
```

Once the code above runs, the URL to download the file will be available in the `file.url` property.

By default the file URL returned will be temporary and change on each request to this endpoint, and will expire after a short period of time and thus should not be stored long-term, but if the file was created with a 'public_content' access policy then this URL will be permanent and can be stored long-term.

##### Uploading from an existing URL

Or if the file is already available in a URL and you want to download and then upload it to Botpress Cloud you can pass it in the `url` parameter instead of using the `content` parameter:

```javascript
const file = await client.createAndUploadFile({
  name: 'test.pdf',
  url: 'https://example.com/test.pdf',
  index: true,
})
```

##### Uploading a binary file

If you are dealing with a binary file such as a PDF or Microsoft Office document you can also pass a `Buffer` object as the `content` parameter for the file:

```javascript
const buffer = // This must be a Buffer object containing the binary content of the file

const file = await client.createAndUploadFile({
  name: 'test.pdf',
  content: buffer,
  index: true,
})
```

#### In a custom script using the Botpress Client

If you're using Javascript or TypeScript the easiest way to interact with the API is using the [Botpress Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botpress/client). You can install the client package by running the `npm install @botpress/client` command in your project.

The Botpress Client will handle the authentication and other details for you, you just need to provide your Botpress PAT (Personal Access Token) to the client and the ID of the bot that the client will access. If your use-case requires accessing multiple bots, you can define as many client instances as needed (one for each bot).

You can use the following code snippet to create and upload a file in a custom script using the Botpress Client. Note that in the example below your Botpress PAT (Personal Access Token) and bot ID must be defined in the environment variables `BOTPRESS_PAT` and `BOTPRESS_BOT_ID` respectively.

```javascript
import { Client } from '@botpress/client'

const client = new Client({
  token: process.env.BOTPRESS_PAT,
  botId: process.env.BOTPRESS_BOT_ID,
})

const file = await client.createAndUploadFile({
  name: 'test.txt',
  content: 'This is a test file',
})
```

#### In a custom script using an HTTP client

If you can't use the Botpress Client (e.g. you can't install the package or you're working with a different programming language) you can also use any HTTP client to make requests to the API directly.

Please note that when calling the API directly, an HTTP request to the Botpress API (specifying the file size beforehand) will be needed to create the empty file first, and a separate HTTP request will be needed to upload the file content to the unique upload URL provided in the response of the first request.

Additionally, if you need to access the file URL right away a third request to the "Get File" API endpoint will be needed to get the URL of the file after it has been uploaded.

Here's an example on how to do this using the [`axios` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) in Javascript/TypeScript, note that your Botpress PAT will need to be defined in the environment variable `BOTPRESS_PAT`:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

const fileContent = 'Here goes the content of your file'

const buffer = Buffer.from(fileContent)

// Step 1: Create the file in Botpress Cloud.
// Please note that specifying the file size (in raw bytes, not characters) is required when calling this endpoint.
const res = await axios.post('https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/files', {
  name: 'test.txt',
  size: buffer.byteLength,
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BOTPRESS_PAT}`,
  },
})

// Step 2: Upload the file content to the unique upload URL provided for the created file.
await axios.put(res.data.file.uploadUrl, buffer, { maxBodyLength: Infinity })

// Optional - Step 3: You can call the "Get File" API endpoint to access the file details right away.
const { data: getFileResponse } = await axios.get(`https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/files/${res.data.file.id}`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BOTPRESS_PAT}`,
  },
})

const fileUrl = getFileResponse.file.url // Will contain the public URL of the file if it was created with the 'public_content' access policy, otherwise it will contain a temporary pre-signed URL.
const fileStatus = getFileResponse.file.status // Should be 'indexing_pending' if the file was requested to be indexed, or 'upload_completed' otherwise.
```

### Getting the file's metadata

To get the details of a file you can use the "Get File" API endpoint. You can do this using the Botpress Client (replace `YOUR_FILE_ID` for the actual ID of your file):

```javascript
const file = await client.getFile('YOUR_FILE_ID')
```

> The above example is for an Execute Code card in your bot. If you're using the Botpress Client in a custom script be sure to install and import the client NPM package first and then instantiate the client with your Botpress PAT and bot ID.

Or by calling the API directly (using the Axios library in the example below):

```javascript
const res = await axios.get('https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/files/YOUR_FILE_ID', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BOTPRESS_PAT}`,
  },
})

const file = res.data.file
```

### Listing existing files of a bot

To list all the files of a bot you can use the "List Files" API endpoint. Here's an example using the Botpress Client:

```javascript
const res = await client.listFiles()
const files = res.data.files
```

And here's an example calling the API directly using Axios:

```javascript
const res = await axios.get('https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/files', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BOTPRESS_PAT}`,
  },
})

const files = res.data.files
```

#### Filtering by tags

If you need to filter files by tags, you can just pass the `tags` parameter which should be an object with key-value pairs of tags a file must have in order to be returned. For example:

```javascript
const res = await client.listFiles({
  tags: {
    myTag1: 'value_1',
  },
})
```

If you're making the HTTP request directly to the API please note that you'll need to pass the `tags` parameter as a JSON-serialized, URL-encoded string (the Botpress Client handles this automatically for you). Here's an example:

```javascript
const tags = {
  myTag1: 'value_1',
}

const res = await axios.get('https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/files?tags=' + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(tags)), {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BOTPRESS_PAT}`,
  },
})
```

#### Pagination

The "List Files" API endpoint will only return the 20 most recent files your bot has. If you need to get more files you can use the `nextToken` property returned in the API response to get the next page (if any) of results. For example:

```javascript
let res = await client.listFiles()
const files = res.data.files

if (res.data.nextToken) {
  res = await client.listFiles({ nextToken: res.data.nextToken })
  files.push(...res.data.files)
}

// You can put this in a loop to get all the files if needed.
```

### Updating the file metadata

Currently, only the access policies or tags of a file can be updated. The file content itself cannot be updated, but if you need to change the file content you can create a new file with the updated content and delete the old file.

Here's an example of how to update the access policies and tags of a file using the Botpress Client:

```javascript
await client.updateFile({
  id: 'YOUR_FILE_ID',
  accessPolicies: ['integrations'], // This value will replace the existing access policies of the file.
  tags: {
    // This acts as a "patch" or partial update, so only the tags specified here will be updated, the rest will remain unchanged. If you need to delete an existing tag, you can set it to a `null` value.
    myTag1: 'new_value_2', // This tag will be updated.
    myTag2: null, // This tag will be deleted.
    myNewTag: 'value_3', // This tag will be added.
    // Any other tags not specified here will remain unchanged.
  },
})
```

And here's an example calling the API directly using Axios:

```javascript
await axios.put(
  'https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/files/YOUR_FILE_ID',
  {
    accessPolicies: ['integrations'],
    tags: {
      myTag1: 'new_value_2',
      myTag2: null,
      myNewTag: 'value_3',
    },
  },
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BOTPRESS_PAT}`,
    },
  }
)
```

### Deleting a file

To delete a file you can use the "Delete File" API endpoint. Here's an example using the Botpress Client:

```javascript
await client.deleteFile('YOUR_FILE_ID')
```

And here's an example calling the API directly using Axios:

```javascript
await axios.delete('https://api.botpress.cloud/v1/files/YOUR_FILE_ID', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.BOTPRESS_PAT}`,
  },
})
```

### Searching files

To run a semantic search on your bot's files you can use the "Search Files" API endpoint. This is particularly useful for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementations.

Here's an example using the Botpress Client:

```javascript
const res = await client.searchFiles({
  query: 'what are the most popular products of your company?', // This is the natural language query (e.g. a user's question) to be used for running a semantic search on the files of the bot.
  contextDepth: 1, // Optional (default: 0), allows you prepend and append the surrounding context to each matching passage in the search results
  tags: {
    // Optional, allows you to only search files that match the specified tags. Useful if you only want to search a subset of the bot's files.
    myTag1: 'value_1',
  },
  limit: 30, // Default is 20, maximum is 50 results
})

const passages = res.data.passages

for (const passage of passages) {
  // You can use passage.content here to retrieve the content (including surrounding context, if any) of each matching passage
}
```

You can check the [API reference](/api-documentation/#search-files) for the "Search Files" endpoint for more details on the properties available for each passage object returned in the response.

## Indexing

- You can set the `index` parameter to `true` when creating a file so that the file is indexed for semantic search.
- The file it will initially have a status of "indexing_pending" and will be indexed asynchronously. The time it takes to index the file will depend on the file size and the current load on the system.
- You can check the status of the file by calling the ["Get File"](/api-documentation/#get-file) endpoint and checking that the `file.status` property has changed to "indexing_completed".
- If the indexing failed the status will be set to "indexing_failed" and the reason of the failure will be available in the `failedStatusReason` property of the file.
- The following file formats are supported for indexing: .pdf, .docx, .doc, .pptx, .ppt, .xlsx, .xls, .odt, .txt, .rtf, .csv, .html, .md, .epub, .eml, .msg

## Security

- Files are scoped to a specific bot, which means that their ownership cannot be shared between bots. However, the file can be configured with a `public_content` access policy so it can be downloaded from anywhere.
- A bot has full permissions to access and manage all of its files, regardless of the user that created the file.
- An integration has all permissions on the files that have been created by that integration for the bot they were running on.
- Workspace Members:
  - Viewer: can read, search, and list all files for the bot, regardless of creator, but cannot create or delete files.
  - Developer, Manager, and Administrator: have all permissions on the bot's files, regardless of creator.
  - Billing manager: no permissions on files.
- The "List Files" API endpoint will filter out files that are not accessible to the user calling that API endpoint.

### Access Policies

A file can have a list of special access policies:

- `public_content`: Unauthenticated users can read contents (but not metadata) of the file through a unique permanent URL provided by the API for each file. Without this policy the file URL returned by the API will be temporary and will expire after a short period of time.
- `integrations`: Grants read, search, list access to all integrations of the bot that owns the file.

## Pricing

- There are 2 types of storage: file storage and vector storage
- If a file isn't indexed, it will only consume file storage. If a file is indexed, it will consume BOTH file storage and vector storage.
- 500 MB of file storage and 100 MB of vector storage are included for free in all accounts.
- Additional vector storage can be purchased at $10/month for 10 GB of additional file storage.
- For additional file storage, the account can be upgraded to the [Team plan](https://botpress.com/pricing) which includes 10 GB of file storage.
