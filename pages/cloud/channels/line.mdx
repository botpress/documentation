## Requirements

You will need to create a channel on the LINE Developers Console, and then add that channel to your LINE official account.

### Create a Meta App & Business Account

To create a channel and add it to your official account, you can read the [Getting started with the Messaging API](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/). The next step is configuring the Messaging API [Webhook Settings](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/building-bot).

When you have created everything and are ready for the next step, go to the next section.

## Channel Configuration

To add LINE integration configuration, go to your bot's configuration screen. Then go to the channel tab, and click on LINE.

A screen will pop up asking for the following details:

### 1. Channel Access Token

The **Channel Access Token** is the means of authentication for the channel. You are deemed to have permission to use the channel if the Access Token is correct.

To get the **Channel Access Token**: in your channel configuration, open the **Messaging API** tab, scroll to the bottom to the **Channel Access Token** section, and then generate a new one or copy it if the Channel access token was already issued.

For Long-Lived Channel Access Token: read this [LINE documentation](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/channel-access-tokens/#long-lived-channel-access-tokens).

### 2. Channel Secret

The **Channel Secret** is used to [verify the signature](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/receiving-messages/#verifying-signatures) between LINE and Botpress.

To get the **Channel Secret**: in your channel configuration, open the **Basic settings** tab, scroll to the bottom to the **Channel Secret** section, and then copy the secret.

## Finalizing Channel Configuration

The next step is to **Enable** the channel from the top of the screen and copy the webhook URL from the button below the webhook URL. Then click **Save**.

Now, we proceed to the last step by [setting your webhook URL](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/building-bot/#setting-webhook-url) in LINE.
