1. Create a new zap in your Zapier account and search for "Botpress" either in the Trigger or Action of your zap.
1. Zapier will guide you through the process of authenticating to your Botpress account, follow the steps provided there.
1. Once you have authenticated, when setting up the Trigger or Action of your Zap to use Botpress you'll be asked for the "Webhook URL", which you can find in your Botpress Cloud dashboard inside the "Integrations" tab of your bot and then clicking on the Zapier integration.

### Using Botpress to trigger a Zapier workflow

1. If you're setting up Botpress as a Trigger in Zapier there will be an option to test the trigger and see some sample data that could be received from your bot. Use this to create the rest of your Zap.
1. To make your bot send real data to Zapier, you'll find an action for Zapier when editing your bot in the Botpress Studio which you can use to send data to your zap. It's recommended that you send your data in JSON format so you can send multiple value at once, as Zapier will automatically parse it.

### Using Zapier to trigger an action in your Botpress chatbot

1. If you're setting it up as an Action in Zapier, you can send custom Event Data to your bot and an optional Correlation ID which you can use to associate individual zap runs with a particular event in your bot.
1. Zapier only allows entering a single text value for the Event Data, but you can put a Code Step from Zapier before the Botpress action in your zap in order to construct an object with multiple values and then use `JSON.stringify()` to convert it to a text field that you can use in your zap to pass as the Event Data.
