This integration allows you to connect your Botpress chatbot with Trello, a leading project management platform. With this integration, you can easily manage your boards, lists and cards directly from your chatbot.

## Prerequisites

- A [Trello account](https://trello.com/)
- A board in Trello, with at least one list
- The ID of the list where cards will be created. Refer to [this article](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Trello-questions/How-do-I-find-the-LIST-ID/qaq-p/2272862) to locate it.
- A [Botpress Cloud account](https://sso.botpress.cloud) and a [Botpress Bot](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/getting-started/create-and-publish-your-chatbot/)

## Setting up the Trello integration in Botpress

1. Go to the [Integration Hub](https://app.botpress.cloud/hub) in Botpress Cloud (if you don't have the integration installed yet).
2. Find and open the Trello integration then click on the "Install to Bot" button, now go back to your bot settings.

The Trello integration has the following settings:

- **Enabled**: Whether Botpress will communicate with Trello

2. Once the Power-Up is created, you will be redirected to API Key settings page, displayed below. Generate a new API key, then copy and paste this key into the **API Key** field in Botpress.
