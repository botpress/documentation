# Webhook

![Messaging channels](/docs/content/webhook-banner.png)

Webhooks provide a powerful way to integrate Botpress with other services. This guide will walk you through how to set up a webhook in Botpress to receive updates from Botpress in real-time.

## Enabling Webhook Integration

1. Go to the [Botpress Hub](https://app.botpress.cloud/hub) and install the Webhook Integration to your chatbot
2. Enable this integration in the `integrations` tab of your bot.
3. You will get a WebhookURL that you can use to receive updates from Botpress.
4. (Optional) You can also set a secret token to secure your webhook.

## Sending info to your webhook using Postman

1. Open Postman and create a new request
2. Set the request type to `GET`/`POST`
3. Set the URL to the WebhookURL you got from the Webhook Integration page in the Botpress Dashboard.
4. Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`
5. (Optional) Set the `x-botpress-secret` header to the secret token you set in the Botpress Hub
6. [Example] Set the body to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "Hello Webhooks!",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "name": "User Name"
  },
}
```

7. Send the request and you should see a `200 OK` success response.


## Using the Webhook Event in your bot

1. Go to the Botpress Studio and pick the `Webhook Event` Card and connect it to any of your desired node. This node will be triggered when the webhook is called.
3. Click on `Discover Events` to see the event that was triggered.
4. You can access the event data using the `event.payload.body` variable.
5. You can also filter the events using a valid JS expression. For example, if you want to receive only the events that have a `type` equal to `text`, you can use the following filter: `event.payload.body.type === 'text'`
