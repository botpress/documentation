## Prerequisites

- A [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps) to connect your bot to Slack. Create one from scratch.
- A [Botpress Cloud account](https://sso.botpress.cloud) and a [Botpress Bot](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/getting-started/create-and-publish-your-chatbot/)

## Setting up the Slack integration in Botpress

1. Go to the [Integration Hub](https://app.botpress.cloud/hub) in Botpress Cloud (if you don't have the integration installed yet).
2. Find and open the Slack integration then click on the "Install to Bot" button, now go back to your bot.

The Slack integration has the following settings:

- **Enabled**: Whether Botpress will communicate with Slack
- **Webhook URL**: The URL for receiving data in Botpress
- **Bot Token**: The token used to authenticate requests made to Slack
- **Signing Secret**: The secret used to verify the requests

## Setting up Slack

### Bot Token

1. In the left sidebar, click on **Features** > **OAuth & Permissions**
1. Scroll down to the **Scope** > **Bot Token Scopes** section, click **Add an OAuth Scope**. Select the `chat:write` option from the list.
1. Scroll up and click the **Install to Workspace** button in the **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** section
1. In the next screen, your app will request access to your Slack workspace. Click **Allow**.
1. In the **OAuth & Permissions > OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** section, copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**.
1. Copy the token and paste it in the **Bot Token** input in Botpress.

### Signing Secret

The signing secret is used to verify webhook requests

1. In the left sidebar of the app details page, click on **Settings** > **Basic Information**
1. Scroll down to **App Credentials** section. Next to **Signing Secret**, click **Show** to reveal the secret.
1. Copy the secret to the **Signing Secret** input in Botpress.

### Save Configuration

Channel configuration is complete, you can now click **Save**. It is important you save your configuration before configuring the webhooks, otherwise Slack will be unable to validate the webhook url

1. In the left sidebar, click on **Features** > **Event Subscriptions**
1. Turn on events by click the On/Off button

1. Under **Subscribe to bot event**, add `message.im` and `message.channels`
1. Click the **Save Changes** button. Make sure your Slack channel configuration is saved before doing this step, otherwise webhook validation will fail
1. A yellow banner will be displayed at the top of the screen. Click the **reinstall your app** link
1. In the next screen, your app will request access to your Slack workspace. Click **Allow**.

### Interactivity Webhook

Slack sends "interactive" events such as reactions to message to the interactivity webhook

1. In the left sidebar, click on **Features** > **Interactivity & Shortcuts**
1. Turn on interactivity by click the On/Off button
1. Copy paste the webhook url provided in the channel configuration UI to the **Request URL** field
1. Click the **Save Changes** button

## Install App

### Add App to Workspace

Your Slack app needs to be added to your workspace to allow Slack users to communicate with it

1. In the left sidebar, click on **Features** > **App Home**
