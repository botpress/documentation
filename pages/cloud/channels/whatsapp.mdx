## Requirements

You will need a Meta app and a WhatsApp Business Account to connect your bot to WhatsApp

### Create a Meta App & Business Account

To create a Meta App, log in to your Meta account and follow Step (1) & Step (2) in this [article](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#set-up-developer-assets).

Before going to Step (3), we will configure the WhatsApp channel on Botpress.

## Channel Configuration

To add **WhatsApp** integration configuration, go to your botâ€™s configuration screen, then go to the channel tab, and click on **WhatsApp**.

A screen will pop up asking for the following details:

### 1. Verify Token

The Verify Token is used by Meta to verify that you are the real owner of the provided webhook.

You can generate any random alphanumeric string for this configuration. Paste it in your **Verify Token** channel configuration.

### 2. Access Token

The **Phone Number ID** and **Access Token** are used to send and receive messages to/from the WhatsApp API.

In your Meta App:

1.  In the left sidebar, expand the **WhatsApp** menu and select **Getting Started**
2.  In the **Temporary access token** section, click **Copy** and then paste it in the **Access Token** field in Botpress

For a permanent Access Token: [https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/12/05/auth-tokens/](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/12/05/auth-tokens/)

### 3. Phone Number ID

In your Meta App:

1.  In the left sidebar, expand the **WhatsApp** menu and select **Getting Started**
2.  In the **Send and receive messages** section, beside the label **Phone Number ID** click **Copy** then paste it in the **Phone Number ID** field in Botpress

## Finalizing Channel Configuration

The next step is to Enable the channel from the top of the screen and then copy the webhook URL from the button below the webhook URL.

In the last step, click **Save**.

Now we can go back to Step (3) & Step (4) in this [article](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#set-up-developer-assets).

## Creating Conversations

WhatsApp conversations can be proactively initiated with a user only by using [Message Templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/) which need to be created in your [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/message-templates/) dashboard and need to be reviewed and approved first by WhatsApp in order to use them.

Once you have a message template approved by WhatsApp, it's very easy to have your bot initiate a conversation with a user by running the following code inside your bot:

```ts
const response = await client.createConversation({
  integrationName: 'whatsapp',
  channel: 'channel',
  tags: {
    'whatsapp:userPhone': '+1 504 123 456 78', // The full phone number of the user you want to initiate the conversation with.
    'whatsapp:templateName': 'test_message', // This is the name (identifier) of your WhatsApp message template.
    'whatsapp:templateLanguage': 'en_US', // Optional (defaults to `en_US`)
    'whatsapp:templateVariables': JSON.stringify(['John']), // Optional (only needed if your message template uses variables)
  },
})
```

> **Note**: The `client` in the code example above is an instance of the [Botpress Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botpress/client) that is always provided as a prop to the bot handlers (e.g. message handler, event, conversation, state expiry, etc.)
