## Prerequisites

- A [Meta developer app](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/create/). Check out [this article](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#set-up-developer-assets) to learn more about the setup.
- A WhatsApp Business Account to be your bot's interface on WhatsApp
- A [Botpress Cloud account](https://sso.botpress.cloud) and a [Botpress Bot](https://botpress.com/docs/cloud/getting-started/create-and-publish-your-chatbot/)

## Setting up the WhatsApp integration in Botpress

1. Go to the [Integration Hub](https://app.botpress.cloud/hub) in Botpress Cloud (if you don't have the integration installed yet).
2. Find and open the WhatsApp integration then click on the "Install to Bot" button, now go back to your bot.

The WhatsApp integration will have the following settings:

### 1. Verify Token

The **Verify Token** is used by Meta to verify that you are the real owner of the provided webhook.
You can generate any random alphanumeric string for this configuration. Paste it in your **Verify Token** channel configuration.

### 2. Phone Number ID

1. In your Meta App's left sidebar, expand the **WhatsApp** menu and select **Getting Started**
2. In the **Send and receive messages** section, beside the label **Phone Number ID** click **Copy** then paste it in the **Phone Number ID** field in Botpress

### 3. Access Token

The **Phone Number ID** and **Access Token** are used to send and receive messages to/from the WhatsApp API.

1.  In your Meta App's left sidebar, expand the **WhatsApp** menu and select **Getting Started**
2.  In the **Temporary access token** section, click **Copy** and then paste it in the **Access Token** field in Botpress

#### 4. (Optional): Permanent Access Token

**Permanent Access Token** can be used to send and receive messages to/from the WhatsApp API without the need to refresh the token every 24 hours.

1. Navigate to [Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings).
2. Choose the business account associated with your app.
3. Click on `Add` under `System Users`.
4. Enter a name for the system user, assign the `Admin` role, and click `Create System User`.
5. Click on `Create Asset` and select `Apps` from the asset type Tab.
6. Select your app and toggle `Manage App (full control)`.
7. Click `Generate New Token` and select `whatsapp_business_messaging` and `whatsapp_business_management` permission.
8. Copy and save your token.

## Finalizing Channel Configuration

The next step is to Enable the channel from the top of the screen and then copy the webhook URL from the button below the webhook URL.

In the last step, click **Save**.

Now we can go back to Step (3) & Step (4) in this [article](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#set-up-developer-assets).

## Webhook Fields

#### We need to subscribe to the webhook fields below

- Messages: For the chat to work properly, you need to subscribe to the **messages** webhook field.

## Content Types Mapping

### From Botpress to WhatsApp

- Text is mapped to [Text Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#text-object)
- Text with Markdown is mapped to [Text Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#text-object)
- Image is mapped to [Media Image Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object)
- Audio is mapped to [Media Audio Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object)
- Video is mapped to [Media Video Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object)
- File is mapped to [Media File Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#media-object)
- Location is mapped to [Location Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#location-object)

**Special behaviors for choices, cards, and carousels**

Choices (buttons), dropdowns, cards, and carousels are all mapped to [Interactive List Objects.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#interactive-object)

This comes with a few restrictions and behaviors specific to WhatsApp:

- When there are 3 or fewer choices as buttons or in a dropdown, they will be rendered as buttons.
- When there are more than 3 choices as buttons or in a dropdown, they will be rendered as a dropdown.
- If there are more than 10 choices in a dropdown, the multiple dropdown messages will be sent with up to 10 choices in each messsage.
  - For example, if your bot has a dropdown with 10 choices, the user will receive two messages: the first message will have a dropdown with 10 choices, and the second messge will have a dropdown with two choices.
- Each dropdown requires a label but the Studio currently doesn’t support that, so the label “Choose…” is used for all dropdowns.
- Button labels are limited to 20 characters, and dropdown labels are limited to 24 characters.
  - Labels exceeding these limits are automatically truncated. For example, the label "This button label is very long" would become "This button label i…" on a button and "This button label is ve…" on a dropdown.
- There is a limit of 3 URL action buttons on each cards
- Each card in a carousel will be sent individually.
- Whatsapp requires cards to only use "reply" buttons, and doesn't support URLs. If the card only has URL actions, a card won't be able to be displayed and it will be downrendered using normal text/image messages.
- When files are sent over Whatsapp, the Studio doesn't store the original filename (for security reasons) but only the file extension, so the file will be sent with a generic filename ("file") followed by the extension of the file. For example, if you send a PNG file, it will be sent as "file.png".

### From WhatsApp to Botpress

- Text is mapped to Text Object
- Interactive feedbacks are mapped to Text Object.
- The rest of the types are not currently processed by Botpress

## Starting a Conversation Proactively

WhatsApp conversations can be proactively initiated with a user only by using [Message Templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/) which need to be created in your [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/message-templates/) dashboard first and then reviewed and approved by WhatsApp in order to use them.

Once you have a message template approved by WhatsApp, it's very easy to have your bot start a conversation with a user by just using the Whatsapp "**Start Conversation**" card in the Studio:

<Image src="/docs/content/whatsapp-startConversation.png" alt="Screenshot of 'Start Conversation' card in the Studio" />

Then you just need to pass the user's phone number, Whatsapp template name, template language (optional), and template variables (if any, optional) as JSON to proactively start a Whatsapp conversation with a user:

<Image
  src="/docs/content/whatsapp-startConversation-fields.png"
  alt="Options for the Whatsapp 'Start Conversation' card"
/>

Once the conversation is created, if the user replies back it will be processed by your bot as a normal incoming message, so nothing else needs to be done.

> **Tip**: If you need access to the ID of the Botpress conversation created by this action, you can choose to store the output value of this action in a variable. For example, if you choose to store the output in a variable named `whatsappResult`, you can use `{{ workflow.whatsappResult.conversationId }}` in input fields of the Studio (where supported) or use `workflow.whatsappResult.conversationId` to access the conversation ID in code.

#### Creating the conversation using the Botpress Client

If you're not using the Botpres Studio but building a bot as code, you can use the Botpress Client to call this action programatically as shown in the following example:

```ts
const result = await client.callAction({
  type: 'whatsapp:startConversation',
  input: {
    userPhone: '+1 504 123 456 78', // The full phone number of the Whatsapp user you want to initiate the conversation with.
    templateName: 'test_message', // This is the name (identifier) of your WhatsApp message template.
    templateLanguage: 'en_US', // Optional (defaults to `en_US`)
    templateVariablesJson: JSON.stringify(['John', '12345']), // Optional (only needed if your message template uses variables)
  },
})

console.log('Botpress conversation ID: ' + result.conversationId)
```

## Tips

- To get the phone number of the user, use the variable `{{event.tags.conversation['whatsapp:userPhone']}}`. This number also contains the country code and has no spaces, dashes or signs.
- To get the phone number id of the user, read the variable `{{event.tags.conversation['whatsapp:phoneNumberId']}}`
