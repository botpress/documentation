# AI Based Transitions

![Shortcuts](/docs/content/generative-ai-transitions-cover.png)

[AI Transitions](../toolbox/transition-to/#expression) are a feature that allows you to create transitions in plain language so that your chatbot responds to users’ inputs as you want it to.

For example, let's say you have a chatbot that helps customers with their online orders. You could use an AI Transition to create a condition that recognizes when a customer asks about the status of their order.

Here's an example of a transition command in plain language.

```html
“If the customer asks about the status of their order, transition to the node
with current shipping status and estimated delivery date.”
```

With this command, the AI Transition will write the necessary code for your chatbot to recognize when a customer asks about their order status and transition them to the appropriate information.

This feature provides a lot of flexibility for creating a chatbot that can understand and respond to a wide variety of questions and statements. And you don’t need to be a developer to use it - you can simply write out the commands in plain language and the chatbot will do the rest!
