![Shortcuts](/docs/content/generative-ai-prompt-cover.png)

- [AI Prompt Chaining](../toolbox/ai-task/#ai-prompt-chaining) is a technique of connecting multiple AI Task Cards to generate complex content by breaking down a large generative task into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Practical examples of prompt chaining are generating product descriptions, creating personalized email campaigns, and generating complex chatbot responses.
- Prompt chaining improves the accuracy and relevance of generated content by optimizing each AI Task Card to perform a specific task, and using the output of one as input for the next.
- Guidelines and best practices for prompt chaining in Botpress include breaking down large tasks into smaller ones, testing each AI Task Card individually, formatting the output correctly, and using appropriate variable names.
