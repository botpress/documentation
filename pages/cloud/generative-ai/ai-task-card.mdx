- The [AI Task Card](../toolbox/ai-task) is part of the Toolbox in Botpress for generating content using artificial intelligence to automate various tasks.
- To use the AI Task Card, users must provide clear instructions and specific inputs, and define well-named variables.
- The Task Instructions parameter is used to provide a detailed description of the task, including any relevant constraints or guidelines.
- The AI Task Input is the problem subject provided to the AI engine, and should be as specific as possible for more accurate and relevant content generation.
- Users can store the extracted information in variables within Botpress and choose variable names that are easy to understand and identify.
- The Task Example allows users to provide examples of text input and generated outputs to help the AI Task better understand the instructions and output format.
