3. Enable Personality Rewrite and add a description of the personality you want your bot to embody.

4. Specify the tone you want your chatbot to convey, for example, "friendly but professional".

5. Decide how often you want to use emojis, if at all.

6. Consider the context in which the bot will be used and adjust the personality accordingly. For example, if the bot is for a tech startup, the personality might be dynamic and forward-thinking.
