# Generate code using AI

![Shortcuts](/docs/content/generative-ai-code-cover.png)

To use [Generative AI for Execute Code](../toolbox/execute-code/), you simply provide a plain text instruction in natural language, and the AI will generate the corresponding code for you. For example, you can ask the AI to find the difference between two dates or get data from an external API and filter it based on certain criteria. The AI will then generate the code needed to perform these tasks, which you can use in your bot.

Additionally, you can also build your own code using the Axios, Lodash, and Moment Luxon node packages. This allows you to perform more complex tasks or execute code that is specific to your needs.

Overall, Generative AI using Execute Code makes it easier to perform a wide range of tasks within your bot, without the need for extensive coding knowledge.
