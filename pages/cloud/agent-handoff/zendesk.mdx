Turn Botpress chats into Zendesk tickets, with a handy link added to the conversation notes. A Zendesk agent can communicate directly with the user on the same conversation initially handled by the bot on any channels supported by Botpress (e.g. web chat, Whatsapp, Messenger, etc.)

## Getting Started

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to set up the Zendesk integration to facilitate live interactions through the bot.

### Step 1: Add Zendesk Integration 

Firstly, locate your bot's dashboard and click on the integrations tab. Use the search bar to find and select the Zendesk Integration. Once found, install this onto your bot.

### Step 2: Setting up Zendesk Integration

Switch to the Zendesk admin center, and find the Zendesk API menu. Ensure you have both password and token access enabled.

You will then need to create a distinct API token. Copy this for later use.

Return to your bot's dashboard. Here you will need to input your organizational subdomain, your consistent Zendesk account email, and the copied API token. Ensure to save this configuration and activate the newly installed integration.

### Step 3: User Info Accumulation

The bot will need the user's name and their email. This data will be saved to user variables.

Create a 'user.name' and a 'user.email' variable on the bottom-left variables panel. Make sure to select "User" as the scope. Confirmation of the information will be done using simple capture cards.

### Step 4: Enabling HITL Agent

From the "Agents" menu of the bot in Botpress Studio, click on the "HITL Agent" option, and then turn on the "Enable Agent" option.

This menu will allow you to configure options such as choosing Zendesk as the desired integration. Also, you have the capability to design an 'end_conversation' intent that permits the user to opt out of speaking to a live agent. To do so, pick a global intent from the dropdown, for instance "Cancel". 

Most settings are default, you may choose to modify them to your preference.

### Step 5: Activating HITL

Add a new node to your bot in Botpress Studio and then insert a "Start HITL" card, which will trigger the bot into initiating a live agent.

The card will automatically summarize the conversation and provide a transcript for the live agent in the Zendesk menu.

### Step 6: Test the Configuration

Now that everything has been configured accordingly, proceed to test the set-up. Prior to testing, ensure the most recent version of your bot is up and running.

## Zendesk Cards

### Get Ticket

Use this to retrieve details about a specific support ticket from Zendesk. When a user asks about their ticket, the bot can provide real-time updates on the status or details.

This requires a `Ticket ID` to be provided. This can be obtained from the URL of the ticket in Zendesk. For example, if the URL of the ticket is `https://companyname.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/1`, the `Ticket ID` is `1`.


### Find Customer

This helps you search for a customer in your Zendesk account. It's useful when you need to look up customer information to provide personalized support.

This requires a `Search Query` to be provided. This can be the customer's name, email address or phone number. The bot will return a list of matching customers and their details.


### Create Ticket

This allows the chatbot to open a new support ticket in Zendesk on behalf of a user. If a user has an issue that can't be solved by the bot, this card will let the bot create a ticket for human support.

This requires the `Ticket subject`, `Ticket comment`, `Requester name` and `Requester email` to be provided. 

The `Ticket subject` is the title of the ticket, the `Ticket comment` is the initial message that will be sent to the support agent, the `Requester name` is the name of the user who is requesting support and the `Requester email` is the email address of the user who is requesting support.

### Close Ticket

When a problem is resolved, this card can be used to close a ticket in Zendesk. This signifies that the issue has been dealt with and no further action is required.

This requires a `Ticket ID` to be provided. This can be obtained from the URL of the ticket in Zendesk. For example, if the URL of the ticket is `https://companyname.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/1`, the `Ticket ID` is `1`.

Optionally, you can provide a `Closing Comment` to be added to the ticket when it is closed. This can be used to provide a summary of the resolution or to thank the user for their patience.


### List Agents

This card provides a list of available support agents. It's useful for letting users know who is available to help or for assigning tickets to specific agents.

You can tick off the `Is Online` checkbox to only show agents who are currently online. This can be used to prevent users from assigning tickets to agents who are not available.

### Get Ticket Conversation

With this, the bot can fetch recent comments on a ticket. This is handy for providing users with the latest updates or responses from support agents on their issues.

This requires a `Ticket ID` to be provided. This can be obtained from the URL of the ticket in Zendesk. For example, if the URL of the ticket is `https://companyname.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/1`, the `Ticket ID` is `1`.

### Set Conversation Requester

This allows you to change the requester of a ticket. This is useful when a user is requesting support on behalf of someone else. For example, if a user is requesting support for their friend, you can use this card to change the requester of the ticket to the friend's name and email address.

This requires a `Conversation ID` and a `Requester ID`. The `Conversation ID` of a Ticket can be obtained from the `Get Ticket Conversation` card and the `Requester ID` can be obtained from the URL of the requester's profile in Zendesk. For example, if the URL of the requester's profile is `https://companyname.zendesk.com/agent/users/1`, the `Requester ID` is `1`.

## Zendesk Triggers

### Assigned Ticket

This trigger is fired when a ticket is assigned to an agent. This can be used to notify the agent that they have a new ticket to work on.

### Ticket Solved

This trigger is fired when a ticket is marked as solved. This can be used to notify the user that their issue has been resolved.


<Callout type="info">
  **Note** <br />
You can add a message after these triggers to send a notification to the agent. For example, you can use the `Send Message` card to send a message to the agent's Slack channel.
