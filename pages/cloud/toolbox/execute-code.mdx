Example 1:

**"I want to find the difference between the variables startDate and the endDate"**

Generated Output:

```typescript
const startDate = luxon.fromISO(workflow.startDate) // convert the startDate string to a luxon DateTime object
const endDate = luxon.fromISO(workflow.endDate) // convert the endDate string to a luxon DateTime object
const diffInDays = endDate.diff(startDate, 'days').toObject().days // find the difference between the two dates in days
// store the difference in days in the workflow variable 'dateDiff' as requested
workflow.dateDiff = diffInDays
```

<br />
Example 2:

**"I want to get all my issues from Jira filtered by what is not done"**<br/>

Generated Output:

```typescript
const jiraUrl = 'https://your-jira-url.com'
const jiraUsername = 'your-jira-username'
const jiraPassword = 'your-jira-password'

// get the current date and time in ISO format
const now = luxon.local().toISO()

// create the JQL query to get all issues that are not done
const jql = `status != Done AND updated >= "${now}" ORDER BY updated DESC`

// set the request headers for Jira API
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  Authorization: `Basic ${Buffer.from(`${jiraUsername}:${jiraPassword}`).toString('base64')}`,
}

// make the request to Jira API to get all issues that are not done
const response = await axios.get(`${jiraUrl}/rest/api/2/search?jql=${jql}`, { headers })

// filter the response to only keep the issues that are not done
const issues = _.filter(response.data.issues, (issue) => issue.fields.status.name !== 'Done')
```

#### Advanced

You can build your own code here, using below node packages:

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15)
- [Moment Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon)

Using the above packages, you will be able fetch and display the user-submitted city's weather information using an API.
