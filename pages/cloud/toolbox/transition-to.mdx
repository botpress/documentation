# Transition to


A Transition is like a "decision point" in a conversation with a chatbot, where the bot has to decide what to do next based on what the user has said or done. It's like a set of instructions that the bot follows to determine which "path" to take in the conversation.

<br />
For example, if the user says something specific, the bot may need to ask a follow-up question or provide a certain response.

The transition statement is what tells the bot which response or question to provide based on what the user has said or done.

## Expression

An Expression transition is a conditional statement that tells the bot which node should be processed next if the condition is met. It uses generative AI to generate the conditions using plain text.

<br />
This type of transition allows you to check user input, user variables, workflow variables, and even create advanced JavaScript
expressions to determine which node the bot should transition to next.
<br />
You can use a combination of these checks to create complex conditions that will determine which node the bot will transition
to next.

### Adding an "Always" Transition

An "Always" transition is a transition that will always be transitioned, regardless of the user's input.

Drag the Transition Card and set condition to `true` to create an "Always" transition.

  **Generative AI Transitions** <br/>
  You can use generative AI to generate your conditions using plain text. In order to achieve what you exactly want,
  here are some examples that should guide you, but you are not limited to it:
</Callout>

<Table>
  <Tr>
    <Td>**Example**</Td>
    <Td>**Description**</Td>
  </Tr>
  <Tr>
    <Td>User Input</Td>
    <Td>
      To check if the user entered a value between 1 and 10, you can use **User Input** <br/>Example: *user input is between 1 & 10*
    </Td>
  </Tr>
  <Tr>
    <Td>User Variable</Td>
    <Td>
To retrieve a value from the user variable, you can use **`user.{variable name}`** <br/>
Example: *user language is <u>English</u>*
    </Td>
  </Tr>
  <Tr>
    <Td>Workflow Variable</Td>
    <Td>To check a workflows variable, you can use **`workflow.{variable name}`**<br/>
    Example: *workflow variable supportEmail contains Botpress*</Td>
  </Tr>
  <Tr>
    <Td>Intents</Td>
    <Td>You can combine multiple checks together, for example you can check if an intent is of type "affirmative", and its confidence is more than 50%. <br/>
      Example: *intent is affirmative and intent confidence is 50%* </Td>
  </Tr>
  <Tr>
    <Td>Advanced</Td>
    <Td>
      You can use an advanced javascript expression to move from one node to the next when the expression satisfies the condition.
    </Td>
</Tr>

</Table>

## Intent

An Intent transition allows you to create an inline intent (or node-specific intent). Only if this intent is elected will the condition be met.

<br />
This type of transition is useful when you want to create a specific response for a particular intent. You can create an
intent for a specific node, and the bot will transition to that node only if that intent is detected in the user's message.
<br />
For example, if a user says "I want to book a hotel room," the bot can transition to a node that is specific to handling
hotel room bookings.
