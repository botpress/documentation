# Send Message

![Send Message](/docs/content/toolbox-1-cover.png)

Botpress cloud lets you send 8 different types of messages to your users! Content types like text, images, and audio look different depending on which channel you're using (Web Chat, WhatsApp, MS Teams etc).

Your bot's content can be as straightforward or as complex as you want. For instance, a content type could be simple text or an image or a carousel. You can add content by dragging a Content Card over to a Node.
