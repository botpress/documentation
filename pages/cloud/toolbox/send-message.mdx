## Send Message

You can **Send Message** using 8 built-in content-types. A Content-Type defines the structure of what the chatbot sends. It also dictates how your chatbot should render the content. It can be as straightforward or as complex as you want. For instance, a content type could be simple text or an image or a carousel.
You can add Content by dragging a Content Card over to a Standard Node.

    <Td>
      The text content type denotes a regular text message with optional typing
      indicators. You can write HTML in the text content on the web channel, and
      your chatbot will render it correctly. This opens up the possibility of
      including iFrames and constructing miniature web pages (commonly known as
      web views) in your content without creating custom components.
