# Share your Chatbot

![Styling Webchat](/docs/content/chatbot-sharing-cover.png)

In Botpress Studio, sharing your published chatbot is made easy through the use of a URL generated specifically for your bot. This URL can be shared with others, allowing them to access and interact with your chatbot for testing purposes or general use.

## Ways to share your Chatbot

### Share Button in Studio

The share button, located in the top-right corner of the Studio interface, provides access to this feature.

### Shareable URL from Admin Dashboard

Go to Botpress Admin Dashboard -> Select your Chatbot -> Channels -> Webchat -> Preconfigured -> Shareable URL

However, it's important to note that the share button is only enabled once you have published your chatbot using the publish button.

This URL can then be distributed to individuals or teams who need to test or utilize your chatbot. By sharing the URL, others can easily access and interact with your chatbot through a web browser, eliminating the need for them to install any additional software.
