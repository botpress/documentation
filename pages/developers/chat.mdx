# Chat API

## Introduction

The Chat API is an HTTP-based API that allows you to interact with a Botpress bot through a backend. It is similar to the Webchat API, but it is designed to be used by backend services.

## Setup and Configuration

To use the Chat API, you must install the `@botpress/chat` package. You can do this by running the following command:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```
  npm install @botpress/chat
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```
  yarn add @botpress/chat
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ```
  pnpm install @botpress/chat
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You'll need to provide the `Webhook URL` in the integration configuration where the Chat API will send the messages and events. This URL must be a public URL accessible from the internet.

You can also configure the `Webhook Secret` to secure the communication between your backend and the Chat API. This secret will be used to make API requests to the Chat API.

## Demo

You can take a look at the following demo to see how the Chat API works:

Also, the [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@botpress/chat) has a few examples on how to use the Chat API.
