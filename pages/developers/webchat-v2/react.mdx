# Webchat React Library

<Callout type="warning">
  When using the react library, the configuration in the dashboard will not be used. You will need to configure the webchat using the React components.
</Callout>

The Webchat React library is a set of React components that makes it easy to embed a webchat in any application or build a more advance version of the actual webchat. It is the building block for the Webchat UI.

Let's start simple, there are 3 main components to get started with the Webchat React library:

### Webchat

The `Webchat` component is the main component that will render the webchat. It must be wrapped in a `WebchatProvider` to work.

### useClient

The `useClient` hook is a custom hook that will create an instance of the `WebchatClient`. It requires a `clientId` prop that is a unique identifier for the client.

### WebchatProvider

The `WebchatProvider` component is a context provider that will provide the webchat with the necessary configuration. It requires a `client` prop that is an instance of the `WebchatClient`. The `WebchatProvider` must be provided for any Webchat component to work.

### Theme & Styles

The `WebchatProvider` component also accepts a `theme` prop which is an object that will style the webchat. Read the [extending Botpress themes](theming/extending-botpress-themes) to generate the `theme object` and `stylesheet`.

### What it looks like

```jsx /WebchatProvider/ /Webchat/ /useClient/
import "./style.css"
import theme from "./theme.json"

import { Webchat, WebchatProvider, useClient } from '@botpress/webchat'

const App = () => {
  const client = useClient({ clientId: '453254325-54325-435-345-345534253' })

  return (
    <WebchatProvider client={client} theme={theme}>
      <Webchat />
    </WebchatProvider>
  )
}
```

This is the simplest way to get started with the Webchat React library. After this, we'll get into more advanced topics like advance components, custom messages components, and more.

## Webchat Advance Components

The webchat offers 4 advanced components to help you build a more advanced version of the webchat. These components are:

<Cards>
  <Card title="<Message List />" href="react/message-list" />
  <Card title="<Fab />" href="react/fab" />
  <Card title="<Header />" href="react/header" />
  <Card title="<Composer />" href="react/composer" />
</Cards>
