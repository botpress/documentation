# Webchat React Library

The Webchat React library is a set of React components that makes it easy to embed a webchat in any application or build a more advance version of the actual webchat. It is the building block for the Webchat UI.

Let's start simple, there are 3 main components to get started with the Webchat React library:

### Webchat

The `Webchat` component is the main component that will render the webchat. It must be wrapped in a `WebchatProvider` to work.

### useClient

The `useClient` hook is a custom hook that will create an instance of the `WebchatClient`. It requires a `clientId` prop that is a unique identifier for the client.

### WebchatProvider

The `WebchatProvider` component is a context provider that will provide the webchat with the necessary configuration. It requires a `client` prop that is an instance of the `WebchatClient`. The `WebchatProvider` must be provided for any Webchat component to work.

### Theme

{/* TODO! finish this section */}
The `WebchatProvider` component also accepts a `theme` prop that is an object that will style the webchat .

### What it looks like

```jsx /WebchatProvider/ /Webchat/ /useClient/
import "./style.css"
import theme from "./theme.json"

import { Webchat, WebchatProvider, useClient } from '@botpress/webchat'

const App = () => {
  const client = useClient({ clientId: '453254325-54325-435-345-345534253' })

  return (
    <WebchatProvider client={client} theme={theme}>
      <Webchat />
    </WebchatProvider>
  )
}
```
