# Publish your integration on Botpress Hub

We're thrilled you want to publish your integration on the Botpress Hub! To ensure the quality of contributions on the Botpress Hub, we've come up with the following application process.

## Your profile on Botpress Hub 
We suggest you create a Workspace specifically for publishing integrations, as this will make it easier to add collaborators to your workspace, and keep your production and dev environments separate.

In your Botpress Workspace's configuration:

- [ ]  Make sure your Workspace has a url handle that represents you. 
- [ ]  Add a way for integration users to contact you, like an email or a website
- [ ]  Introduce yourself in the Workspace snippet
- [ ]  Add an icon to your Workspace that represents you

When a user installs the app, these may be shown to the user.


## Your integration's display information

Your integration's integration.definition.ts file should contain:

- [ ]  **title**: the display title of your integration for the hub. Do not include “Botpress”.
- [ ]  **name**: your_workspace_handle/integration_handle
- [ ]  **description**: a succinct description of what your integration does.
- [ ]  **icon**: the icon of the service you are connecting to, or the problem you are solving. Do not use the Botpress Icon.
- [ ]  **readme**: the name of the markdown file in the folder that contains the integration code. It should contain an explanation of what the integration is, and how to use it. Self-promotion is not allowed here.

## Your integration's logic

- [ ]  If your integration requires parameters to be configured: it should validate the parameters in the register method, and throw a RuntimeError if there is an issue.

```
import * as bpclient from "@botpress/client";

...

throw new bpclient.RuntimeError(
	"Configuration Error! The Mixpanel token is not set. Please set it in your bot integration configuration."
);
```

## Submitting your integration to our team for approval
- [ ]  In your workspace, add a bot and configure your integration for it, with some example flows that demonstrate the integration's capabilities. If any external test account is used, please provide credentials.
- [ ]  When you're done with these steps, add `hub-applications@botpress.com` to your workspace with Admin privileges and send an email to it linking to the integration you'd like to publish as well as a .bpz export of the bot that has your integration configured.

You can also send an email to [hub-applications@botpress.com](mailto:hub-applications@botpress.com) if you have any questions!
