### Controlling the Webchat Widget

This library is a toolkit that provides various tools (or functions) to interact with the Botpress Webchat.

```js
window.botpressWebChat = {
  init,
  mergeConfig,
  onEvent,
  sendPayload,
  sendEvent,
}
```

---

### Initializing the Widget

This function initializes the webchat and connects it to your bot. You must do this before anything else.

```js
window.botpressWebChat.init({
  botId: '<botID>',
  hostUrl: 'https://cdn.botpress.cloud/webchat/v1',
  messagingUrl: 'https://messaging.botpress.cloud',
  clientId: '<clientID>',
})
```

You can find information on the configuration parameters [here](#configurable-script-parameters).

---

### Changing the Widget's Configuration

After initializing the widget, if you want to update it, send a configuration object for the changes you want. You don't need to re-include everything else.

```js
window.botpressWebChat.mergeConfig({ showTimestamp: false })
```

You can find information on the configuration parameters [here](#configurable-script-parameters).

---

### Send user data from your website to Botpress

You can send data from your website to the webchat using the `init` function. Important : the `mergeConfig` doesn't allow you to pass user data.
To send information, submit a flat (without nested objects) object to the `userData` property.

```js
window.botpressWebChat.init({
  userData: {
    name: 'Jack Black',
  },
})
```

<Callout type="warning">
  All the parameters sent to the userData object should be string typed.
</Callout>

You can receive data from the webchat in Botpress by using `Get User Data` Card in the flow. In the User ID field, add `{{event.userId}}`.

---

### Trigger Widget Actions

This function allows you to send a custom event to the chat. Think of it as sending a signal to the chat for it to do something specific.

```js
// Show the chat
window.botpressWebChat.sendEvent({ type: 'show' })

// Hide the chat
window.botpressWebChat.sendEvent({ type: 'hide' })

// Toggle the chat
window.botpressWebChat.sendEvent({ type: 'toggle' })

// Toggle the bot info page
window.botpressWebChat.sendEvent({ type: 'toggleBotInfo' })

// Create a new conversation
window.botpressWebChat.sendEvent({ type: 'createConversation' })

// Load a conversation by ID
window.botpressWebChat.sendEvent({ type: 'loadConversation', conversationId: '6ffe8622-49fd-4de9-81e5-412ba2296913' })
```

To load a conversation, you must provide the conversation ID. You can get the conversation ID from the event payload of a `MESSAGE.SENT` event.

---

### Sending messages or instructions from your website

You can use the `sendPayload` function to send a specific message (or instruction) to the chatbot. For sending instructions, please refer to [Triggers](../../cloud/toolbox/events-triggers#webchat-triggers).

```js
window.botpressWebChat.sendPayload({ type: 'text', text: 'I am a message sent through code' })
```

You can see examples of all of the message types you can send to the chatbot [here](https://github.com/botpress/messaging/blob/master/packages/channels/example/payloads.json).

---

### Listening to Widget Events

This function lets you listen for certain events happening in the chat and then do something when they happen. It's like setting up a watch for specific actions.
You can find the list of events [here](../../cloud/toolbox/events-triggers#webchat-lifecycle-and-events).

```js
window.botpressWebChat.onEvent(
  (event) => {
    if (event.type === 'MESSAGE.RECEIVED') {
      console.log('A new message was received!')
    }
  },
  ['MESSAGE.RECEIVED']
)
```
