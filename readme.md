# Botpress Documentation

This repository contains the source code for the Botpress documentation website.

## Issues

Issues are disabled in the repository.

If you find any problems in the documentation, have any suggestions for the documentation or Botpress Cloud in general, or want to report a bug, please reach out to us on [our discord server](https://discord.gg/botpress).

This is to ensure your issue is addressed as soon as possible and to keep all the information in one place.

## Contributions

If you feel like addressing a documentation issue yourself, you can contribute by raising a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) directly on this Github Repo.

There are two ways to contribute to the documentation:

1. Run the documentation locally and make changes to the documentation files.
2. Click on the **Edit this Page** link on the documentation page and make changes directly on the Github Repo. ![Alt text](public/content/contributing.png) _The **Feedback** and **Edit this page** links can be found on the bottom right corner of most pages_

In both cases you will need to raise a Pull Request to get your changes merged into the main branch.

### Previews

When you raise a PR, after a few minutes you can inspect the preview link of the change you made. Click on the **Visit Preview** preview link. ðŸ’¡ _Please make sure you append `/docs` at the end of the link_.

### Approval Process

Before your change is reflected on the live documentation website, your PR has to be approved by two members of the Botpress team. Though we try to act on every PR as soon as possible, in some cases this process might take up to few weeks.
