### Authoring Commits

At Botpress Engineering, and by extension in this repository, we follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples) standard. This makes sure that each commit clearly describes what it is about.

### Previews

When you raise a PR, after a few minutes you can inspect the preview link of the change you made. Click on the **Visit Preview** preview link. ðŸ’¡ _Please make sure you append `/docs` at the end of the link_.

### Approval Process

Before your change is reflected on the live documentation website, your PR has to be approved by two members of the Botpress Engineering team. Though we try to act on every PR as soon as possible, in some cases this process might take up to two weeks.

## Known issues

There's an issue in Nextra's Table of Contents `TOC` components that can cause the TOC element to scroll up and back to a link/slug that shouldn't be in focus.
